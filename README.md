## IBYKUS TEST

Ibykus test includes code I wrote during my internship at ibykus. You can see a system which tests websites. The tests, which are written in it, were written for 2 internal Ibykus websites, which are not accessible.

### HOW IT WORKS
when the jar file is executed, the main class `test.amon.ibykus.Main` is accessed. For this an argument is passed*, which specifies the core, which should start the project. Then a Chrome browser is opened, which opens the page of the core and executes all tests.

###### _*If no argument is given it will be asked at start_
